Boxgine is a script for generating art out of ascii box characters in a text grid and now 
isometric pieces on an html canvas.

##About
It started out as a wpf application I made after staring at my BIOS too long. After it was 
sitting around unused for a couple months I started porting it to different languages for 
practice.
